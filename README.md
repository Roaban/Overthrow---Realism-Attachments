**Overthrow Realism Mods**
===============================

A collection of sound, light and character tweaks that make for a more realistic experience.

I am not the author of these mods I am purely collating them together for convenience, We are running all these on our server without any obvious problems.

This is the list of items within this collection:

Another mod we have been looking at is TPW, however, it does not work on a dedicated server and only partially works on Coop, it is mainly designed for single player, the mod is pretty good, it adds ambient sounds in the towns and villages to make them seem alive, it also provides buildings with furniture and lighting, and much more.

I hope this helps or enhances your overthrow experience.
